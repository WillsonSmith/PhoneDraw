#PhoneDraw

An experiment using `<canvas>` and Javascript touch events to make a full page drawing web application.

This experiment uses [QuoJS](http://quojs.tapquo.com/) for double tap events.


##How To Use
1. Download the Source
2. Run a local server, or upload to your website/hosting provider
3. Open the web page on your mobile device (iPad, iPhone, Android device etc.)
 * Note: your device must support Canvas, and EventListeners touchstart, touchmove, and touchend.
 
 
###Some Other Notes
* If you download and open the index.html in a browser it will be a blank slate with a banner.
 * This is normal, the entire page is a canvas element.
 * Note that mouse events do not function to draw, this MUST be used on a touch enabled device.
